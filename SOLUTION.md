# Solution for WEBDEV-EXERCISE #

In the index.html file, I added my comments about the errors or findings. Both index.html and style.css are untouched and I have created two other files(**final.html & styles.css**) where I fixed those errors and improved the code quality.

## Issues found ##

1. Link about external js file
2. Favicon missing
3. Title element is missing from `<head>`
4. Unused ids
5. ***alt*** attribute is missing from `<img/>` elements(line: 26, 36)
6. Same class name for multiple elements(line: 38, 39, 42, 45)
7. Footer content inside `<div>` element(line: 60)
8. Empty `<div>` (line: 63)
9. Unclosed element `<div>` - for ***footer*** 
10. Unclosed element `<div>` - for ***structureWrapper*** 
11. Naming conventions - lowercase is favorable for `elements`, `attributes & their values`, `classes` and `ids`
12. Naming conventions - class and id with multi-word such as `gridWrapper` could be `gridwrapper` or `grid-wrapper`
13. Should use text, instead of image of the text(line: 26)
14.

From **final.html** and **styles.css**, one can see my solution. Here I tried to fix all those issues mentioned above.
